# [GratefulTime](https://gratefultime.app) - The modern digital gratitude journal

GratefulTime is a digital gratitude journal featuring Apple sign-in, daily timed notifications, and the ability to log three gratitude items plus a writing prompt. It includes a calendar for reviewing entries, customizable unlock time and time zone settings, and AI-generated monthly summaries.

I used React Native with Expo for the [frontend](https://github.com/eesazahed/gratefulness-mobile). For the [backend](https://github.com/eesazahed/gratefulness-backend) I used a Python Flask server with a Supabase Postgres database.
